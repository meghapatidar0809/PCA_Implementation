# PCA-Based Least Squares Classifier on Diabetes Dataset
### Overview
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to an eight-dimensional diabetes dataset and uses the first two principal components to build a least squares classifier. The classifier is trained on an 80% stratified split of the dataset while ensuring class balance and evaluated on the remaining 20%.

### Steps:
### 1. Data Preprocessing
### 2. Visualization
### 3. Least Squares Classifier

### Dependencies:
-> Python 3.x
-> NumPy
-> Pandas
-> Scikit-learn
-> Seaborn
-> Plotly
